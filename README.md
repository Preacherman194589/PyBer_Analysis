# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 

CEO V. Isualize of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, asked that her data analysis department develop numerous charts and visualization charts to capture the total number of rides, drivers, and fares and percentages of those numbers throughout the city types (rural, suburban, urban). CEO V. Isualize wants to improve PyBer's access, affordability, and service to the community. 

## Results

After conducting our research, we noticed the great dispersion of fares, drivers, and riders in certain areas. 

The urban areas had the greatest turnout of riders, drivers, and fares, the high turnout because of the economy, family structure, and work-related. We differently understand that there is a high population within an urban community. Below are numbers that contribute to our company findings: 




As for the suburban communities, the number of fares and riders was lower than in the rural community but higher than in the urban community. The family-oriented community most likely contributed to the numbers; we know of many families and middle-class families that live in suburban a community and have somewhat less need for transportation when dealing with ride-sharing compared to a rural community with more of a need.  

The rural community displays the lowest number of both city types. Based on location and population, most families that live in rural areas are land owners and production or farm owners who usually don't need ride-sharing.

## Summary

Based on our findings, there could be a lot of contributions to the numbers among the city types. As you noticed from the graph above and our research, we neared it down to three types of business recommendations that would address the issue and concerns.       
 1. **Fare**: We noticed that the fares between the city types were a major concern. It could be based on location, terrain, or availability; however, it should never be of the economy. In negotiation, a flat rate based on mileage could help the company and the rider.  
 2. **Driver**: To better serve the need of drivers, the company needs to improve its training and recruiting department could also help the company's growth and recruit and train qualified employees who are more interested in working in different city types and have a better understanding of the company's deficiencies and growth. The best critique is not just the customers but your employees.  
 3. **Riders**: To better serve your service, is your advertisement and customer assurance. The company needs to look into advertising more in rural and suburban areas. To understand their audience, they need to look into additional research that could better understand their needs and wants for such city types.
